# ARTISTS Model and Repository Classes Design Recipe

## 1. Design and create the Table

If the table is already created in the database, you can skip this step.

Otherwise, [follow this recipe to design and create the SQL schema for your table](https://github.com/makersacademy/databases/blob/main/resources/single_table_design_recipe_template.md).

*In this template, we'll use an example table `students`*

```
# EXAMPLE

Table: students

Columns:
id | name | cohort_name
```

## 2. Create Test SQL seeds

Your tests will depend on data stored in PostgreSQL to run.

If seed data is provided (or you already created it), you can skip this step.

```sql
-- EXAMPLE
-- (file: spec/seeds_{table_name}.sql)

-- Write your SQL seed here.

-- First, you'd need to truncate the table - this is so our table is emptied between each test run,
-- so we can start with a fresh state.
-- (RESTART IDENTITY resets the primary key)

TRUNCATE TABLE students RESTART IDENTITY; -- replace with your own table name.

-- Below this line there should only be `INSERT` statements.
-- Replace these statements with your own seed data.

INSERT INTO students (name, cohort_name) VALUES ('David', 'April 2022');
INSERT INTO students (name, cohort_name) VALUES ('Anna', 'May 2022');
```

Run this SQL file on the database to truncate (empty) the table, and insert the seed data. Be mindful of the fact any existing records in the table will be deleted.

```bash
psql -h 127.0.0.1 your_database_name < seeds_{table_name}.sql
```

## 3. Define the class names

Usually, the Model class name will be the capitalised table name (single instead of plural). The same name is then suffixed by `Repository` for the Repository class name.

```ruby
# EXAMPLE
# Table name: artists

# Model class
# (in lib/student.rb)
class Artist
end

# Repository class
# (in lib/student_repository.rb)
class ArtistRepository
end
```

## 4. Implement the Model class

Define the attributes of your Model class. You can usually map the table columns to the attributes of the class, including primary and foreign keys.

```ruby
# EXAMPLE
# Table name: students

# Model class
# (in lib/student.rb)

class Artist

  # Replace the attributes by your own columns.
  attr_accessor :id, :name, :cohort_name
end

# The keyword attr_accessor is a special Ruby feature
# which allows us to set and get attributes on an object,
# here's an example:
#
# student = Student.new
# student.name = 'Jo'
# student.name
```

*You may choose to test-drive this class, but unless it contains any more logic than the example above, it is probably not needed.*

## 5. Define the Repository Class interface

Your Repository class will need to implement methods for each "read" or "write" operation you'd like to run against the database.

Using comments, define the method signatures (arguments and return value) and what they do - write up the SQL queries that will be used by each method.

```ruby
# EXAMPLE
# Table name: artists

# Repository class
# (in lib/student_repository.rb)

class ArtistRepository

  # Selecting all records
  # No arguments
  def all
    # Executes the SQL query:
    # SELECT id, name, genre FROM artists;

    # Returns an array of Artist objects.
  end

  # Gets a single record by its ID
  # One argument: the id (number)
  def find(id)
    # Executes the SQL query:
    # SELECT id, name, genre FROM artists WHERE id = $1;

    # Returns a single Artist object.
  end

  # Add more methods below for each operation you'd like to implement.

  # insert a new artist
  # takes an Artist object as argument
  def create(artist)
    # execute SQL query
    # INSERT INTO artists (name, genre) VALUES ($1, $2);

    # Doesn't need to return anything b/c it's only creating
  end

  # deletes an artist record
  # given an id
  def delete(id)
    # executes SQL code
    # DELETE FROM artists WHERE id = $1;

    # Returns nothing, only delets
  end

  # updates an artist record
  # takes an artist object (with the updated field)
  def update(artist)
    # executes SQL code
    # UPDATE artists SET name = $1, genre = $2 WHERE id = $3;

    ## Returns nothing (only updates the record)
  end

  # selects artist record along with associated albums
  #given the artist ID
  def find_with_albums(id)
    # executes SEL code
    # SELECT albums.id AS "album_id",
        # albums.title AS "title",
        # artists.genre AS "genre",
        # albums.release_year AS "release_year",
        # artists.id AS "id",
        # artists.name AS "name"
        # FROM albums
        # JOIN artists
        # ON albums.artist_id = artists.id
        # WHERE artists.id = $1;

        # returns an artist object as array of album object
  end


end
```

## 6. Write Test Examples

Write Ruby code that defines the expected behaviour of the Repository class, following your design from the table written in step 5.

These examples will later be encoded as RSpec tests.

```ruby
# EXAMPLES

# 1
# Get all artists

repo = ArtistRepository.new

artists = repo.all
artists.length # => 2
artists.first.id # => 1
artists.first.name # => 'Pixies'

# # 2
# # Get a single artist

 repo = ArtistRepository.new

 artist = repo.find(1)
 artist.name # => 'Pixies'
 artist.genre # => 'Rock'

# # 3
# # Get another single artist

 repo = ArtistRepository.new

 artist = repo.find(2)
 artist.name # => 'Blink-182'
 artist.genre # => 'Alternative'
# # Add more examples for each method

# 4  CREATE TEST
  # create a new artist
  repo = ArtistRepository.new

  artist = Artist.new
  artist.name = 'Beatles'`
  artist.genre = 'Pop'`

    # creates the artist
  repo.create(artist) # => returns nil

    # verify this is working by calling all artists...
  artists = repo.all
    # and seeing the newly inserted one is present at the end of the db
  last_artist = artists.last
  last_artist.name # => 'Beatles'
  last.artist.genre # => 'Pop'

#5  DELETE TEST
  # create a new artist
  repo = ArtistRepository.new

  id_to_delete = 1

  repo.delete(id_to_delete)

  #now there should only be 1 artist (with id = 2) left after the deletion
  all_artists = repo.all
  all_artists.length # => 1
  all_artists.first.id # => '2'

# 6 UPDATE TEST
  repo = ArtistRepository.new

  artist = repo.find(1)

  artist.name = 'Something else'
  artists.genre = 'Disco'

  repo.update(artist)

  # now need to verify the update happened
  updated_artist = repo.find(1)

  updated_artist.name # => 'Something else'
  udpated_artist.genre # => 'Disco'

# FIND WITH method
repo = ArtistRepository.new

artist = repo.find_with_albums(1)

# expect(artist.name).to eq 'Pixies'
# expect(artist.genre).to eq 'Rock'
# expect(artist.length).to eq 2
# expect(artist.first.title).to eq 'Bossanova'

artist.id # 1

artist.albums # is an array of Album objects
artist.albums.last.id # 12


Encode this example as a test.

## 7. Reload the SQL seeds before each test run

Running the SQL code present in the seed file will empty the table and re-insert the seed data.

This is so you get a fresh table contents every time you run the test suite.

```ruby
# EXAMPLE

# file: spec/student_repository_spec.rb

def reset_students_table
  seed_sql = File.read('spec/seeds_students.sql')
  connection = PG.connect({ host: '127.0.0.1', dbname: 'students' })
  connection.exec(seed_sql)
end

describe StudentRepository do
  before(:each) do
    reset_students_table
  end

  # (your tests will go here).
end
```

## 8. Test-drive and implement the Repository class behaviour

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour._
